# X-Ray Engine Overview

The X-Ray Engine is a game engine developed by GSC Game World for their series of first-person shooter games, including the popular S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. It is a powerful and versatile engine that provides a range of features and capabilities for game development.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Graphics**: The X-Ray Engine supports advanced graphics features such as dynamic lighting, real-time shadows, and high-quality textures. These features contribute to creating immersive and visually stunning game environments. For example, dynamic lighting allows for realistic lighting effects that change based on the position and movement of objects in the game world.

- **Physics Simulation**: The X-Ray Engine includes a physics simulation system that enables realistic object interactions. This system handles collision detection, ragdoll physics (simulating the behavior of limp bodies), and environmental destruction. These features enhance the realism and interactivity of the game world. For instance, objects can collide and react to each other, and structures can be damaged or destroyed.

- **AI System**: The X-Ray Engine features an AI system that allows for the creation of intelligent and dynamic non-player characters (NPCs). This system enables NPCs to navigate the game world, interact with objects, and engage in combat. NPCs can exhibit behaviors such as patrolling, searching, and reacting to the player's actions. This adds depth and challenge to the gameplay experience.

- **Modding Support**: The X-Ray Engine has built-in support for modding, which refers to the ability to modify or extend the game's content and functionality. Players and developers can create new levels, modify existing assets (such as textures and models), and add new gameplay mechanics. This flexibility encourages community involvement and allows for a wide variety of user-generated content.

- **Multiplayer Capabilities**: The X-Ray Engine supports multiplayer gameplay, allowing for both cooperative and competitive experiences. It provides networking functionality for seamless online play. This means that players can connect with each other over the internet and interact in real-time, whether it's cooperating to complete objectives or competing against each other.

## Game Development with X-Ray Engine

Developing games with the X-Ray Engine involves a combination of scripting, level design, asset creation, and gameplay programming. The engine provides a set of tools and editors that facilitate these tasks, making it easier for developers to bring their game ideas to life.

### Scripting

The X-Ray Engine uses a custom scripting language called Squirrel. This language allows developers to create game logic, define AI behavior, and implement various gameplay systems. It provides a flexible and powerful framework for game scripting.

### Level Design

Level design involves creating game environments, placing objects, defining gameplay areas, and setting up scripted events. The X-Ray Engine provides a level editor that allows designers to visually create and modify game levels.

### Asset Creation

Creating assets for the X-Ray Engine involves modeling 3D objects, texturing, and animating characters and objects. The engine supports various file formats for importing assets, including 3D models, textures, and animations.

### Gameplay Programming

Gameplay programming in the X-Ray Engine involves implementing game mechanics, integrating systems, and optimizing performance. This includes coding AI behavior, physics interactions, and player controls.
