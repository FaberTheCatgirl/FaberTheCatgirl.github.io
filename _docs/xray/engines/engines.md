# X-Ray Engine Overview

The X-Ray Engine is a game engine developed by GSC Game World for their series of first-person shooter games, including the popular S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series. It is a powerful and versatile engine that provides a range of features and capabilities for game development.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Graphics**: The X-Ray Engine supports advanced graphics features such as dynamic lighting, real-time shadows, and high-quality textures. These features contribute to creating immersive and visually stunning game environments. For example, dynamic lighting allows for realistic lighting effects that change based on the position and movement of objects in the game world.

- **Physics Simulation**: The X-Ray Engine includes a physics simulation system that enables realistic object interactions. This system handles collision detection, ragdoll physics (simulating the behavior of limp bodies), and environmental destruction. These features enhance the realism and interactivity of the game world. For instance, objects can collide and react to each other, and structures can be damaged or destroyed.

- **AI System**: The X-Ray Engine features an AI system that allows for the creation of intelligent and dynamic non-player characters (NPCs). This system enables NPCs to navigate the game world, interact with objects, and engage in combat. NPCs can exhibit behaviors such as patrolling, searching, and reacting to the player's actions. This adds depth and challenge to the gameplay experience.

- **Modding Support**: The X-Ray Engine has built-in support for modding, which refers to the ability to modify or extend the game's content and functionality. Players and developers can create new levels, modify existing assets (such as textures and models), and add new gameplay mechanics. This flexibility encourages community involvement and allows for a wide variety of user-generated content.

- **Multiplayer Capabilities**: The X-Ray Engine supports multiplayer gameplay, allowing for both cooperative and competitive experiences. It provides networking functionality for seamless online play. This means that players can connect with each other over the internet and interact in real-time, whether it's cooperating to complete objectives or competing against each other.
