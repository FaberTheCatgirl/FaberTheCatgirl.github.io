A build serves as a compilation of resources that represents the current status of a project. It is utilized by developers for testing and exploring innovations. Simultaneously, builds act as a "test bed" when distributed without restrictions, aiming to showcase the product's capabilities and identify potential issues. Builds can be encountered across various platforms, including software applications (e.g., browsers like Opera), operating systems (such as Windows Longhorn [later Windows Vista] compilations) spanning different periods, and even in games (like the Half-Life 2 Beta).

In this context, a build refers to a compilation of the X-Ray Engine (or, in the case of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl, Unreal Engine) combined with game assets, allowing for the theoretical execution of these elements as a game application.

A build is primarily identified by a sequence number calculated through a special algorithm. However, due to the algorithm's imperfections, it is more accurate to characterize the build based on the compilation date, which is displayed alongside the number in the initial line of the log.

Technically, a build is essentially a compiled version of the xrCore.dll library. This implies that final game versions, patches, software development kits (SDKs), benchmarks, resourceless binaries, etc., are all considered builds. To avoid confusion, a clear distinction has been established:
