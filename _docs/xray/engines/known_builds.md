A build serves as a compilation of resources that represents the current status of a project. It is utilized by developers for testing and exploring innovations. Simultaneously, builds act as a "test bed" when distributed without restrictions, aiming to showcase the product's capabilities and identify potential issues. Builds can be encountered across various platforms, including software applications (e.g., browsers like Opera), operating systems (such as Windows Longhorn [later Windows Vista] compilations) spanning different periods, and even in games (like the Half-Life 2 Beta).

In this context, a build refers to a compilation of the X-Ray Engine (or, in the case of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl, Unreal Engine) combined with game assets, allowing for the theoretical execution of these elements as a game application.

A build is primarily identified by a sequence number calculated through a special algorithm. However, due to the algorithm's imperfections, it is more accurate to characterize the build based on the compilation date, which is displayed alongside the number in the initial line of the log.

Technically, a build is essentially a compiled version of the xrCore.dll library. This implies that final game versions, patches, software development kits (SDKs), benchmarks, resourceless binaries, etc., are all considered builds. To avoid confusion, a clear distinction has been established:

Game builds are primarily intriguing due to the abundance of cut content. It is noteworthy to recall the interview with the Head of the PR department, Oleg Yavorsky, and several developers from GSC (for instance, on the Kamrad.ru forum). Many of the promised features were eventually discarded, with some remaining only "on paper."

Moreover, builds hold significant appeal for modmakers dedicated to restoring these features in the original game and its add-ons. However, for the average player, this content primarily holds archaeological value. Many builds, especially those from the early period, are nearly unplayable, unstable, and occasionally represent a non-functional collection of code and files. Nevertheless, their main advantage over the final version lies in the indescribable atmosphere of emptiness and loneliness, coupled with beautiful graphics (utilizing minimal computing resources). Regrettably, this unique atmosphere later vanished from Shadow of Chernobyl and subsequent games in the series.

Strictly speaking, the term "builds" should be defined as a "compilation of the X-Ray engine." However, adopting this definition means that not only what is commonly known as a "build" is considered a build, but also the final versions of games, patches for them, and simple binaries without resources.
