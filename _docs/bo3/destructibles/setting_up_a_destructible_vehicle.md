# Setting up a Destructible Vehicle

We will extend what we have learned from creating the destructible wall and use this to create something more complicated but a lot more common, a destructible vehicle.

We will use a vehicle model from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered for demonstration purposes. Most vehicles from Call of Duty titles are set up for destruction, and as we demonstrated in the previous page, it is very easy to create the necessary joints once you have a basic understanding of tools such as Autodesk Maya to define the pieces.
