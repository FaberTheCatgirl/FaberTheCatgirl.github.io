Parasyte is a tool that utilizes the games to load files for us. The tool works by taking game dumps on the users end and using this to load files for us. In theory Parasite can work on any game, but for now it's focus is on modern 64bit titles.

Parasyte is a tool made for those using official game mod tools and making 3D-Art, as a modder myself I understand the love people have for modding games such as Call of Duty: Black Ops III and making renders and would like these avenues open for people who do this stuff out of love for the games, as such, I absolutely do not condone its use for malicious and illegal purposes such as cheating, selling rips, etc.

You can find documentation in the TOC on using Parasyte and how to produce files that it can utilize.

## Requirements

Parasyte requires the following:

* Legal copies of the titles you wish to work with.
* Updated dumps of required data.
* Lots of RAM. (Parasyte can use over 16GB of RAM in some cases.)
